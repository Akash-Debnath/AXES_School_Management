It was the brain child and under an active nourishment of Professor Dr. Mohammad Johurul Islam, presently the Chairman of the Department of Law of Islamic University and formerly Dean of Faculty of Law of Islamic University, Kushtia-the then Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the proposed Legend Trust University. The proposed university campus was duly inspected by two member committee of the University Grants Commission headed by the then UGC member Professor Dr. Atful Hye Shible. They gave a very positive report to the Ministry of Education for approval of the proposed Legend Trust University. But the proposal met an unexpected delay for its approval. In 2015 the Honourable Minister for Information Mr. Hasanul Huq Inu MP, who hails from Kushtia approached and brought the matter before Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Honorable Prime Minister advised Mr. Hasanul Haq Inu to establish a university by the name of the Great Nobel Laureate Poet Rabindranath Tagore.

Concurrently Mr. Hasanul Haq Inu brought the declaration of PM before the audience in a public meeting at Shilaidah Rabindra Kuthibari, organized by the local administration marking the birth anniversary of the Great Poet Rabindranath Tagore. On 11 May 2015, during cabinet meeting Mr. Hasanul Huq Inu drew the kind attention of the Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina about the proposal of the university. In a note-chit, Mr. Hasanul Haq Inu proposed four names of the proposed university relating to the Great Poet’s name, out of which the Honorable Prime Minister selected Rabindra Maitree Univeristy. The selection was warmly welcomed by the Board of Trustees of the proposed Legend Trust University and Board of Trustees took a decision in a general meeting to substitute ‘Rabindra Maitree University’ in the place of proposed ‘Legend Trust University’. In line with the process Mr. Hasanul Haq Inu MP boosted up the proposal by writing a DO letter to the Ministry of Education. The Board of Trustees proposed and earnestly requested Mr. Hasanul Haq Inu MP to become Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the newly proposed Rabindra Maitree University. He cordially accepted the proposal and after a long process on 29 December 2015, the Ministry of Education issued a GO letter to the Chief promoter Professor Dr. Mohammad Johurul Islam as founder regarding approval of the proposed Rabindra Maitree University. In March 2016 as many as 16 programs were submitted to the UGC and after completing the formalities, on principle UGC approved 7 undergraduate programs under 7 different departments including Bengali in September 2017.</span></span></p>

    <p align="justify"><span style="color: #333333;">It is a feeling of utter satisfaction that I look back over the last ten years’ of journey in the formation of </span><span style="color: #333333;">Rabindra Maitree University</span><span style="color: #333333;">. As a teacher of a university, I have always dreamt of establishing an institution on a different scale. I believe that education plays the most important role in changing a society. Through a long assiduous passion now the dream is realized with the cooperation of my dearest members of the Board of Trustees. In 2011 a proposal was made to establish a university named </span><span style="color: #333333;">Legend Trust University</span><span style="color: #333333;"> and the proposal was submitted to the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh for approval with a hope of providing quality education to all classes of students in this region and beyond. Rabindra Maitree University has started its legendary journey with the approval of the Ministry of Education in 2015 and academic activities were started from October, 2017. The proposed </span><span style="color: #333333;">Legend Trust University </span><span style="color: #333333;">is now the reality but it has been renamed as </span><span style="color: #333333;">Rabindra Maitree University </span><span style="color: #333333;">with the blessing and desires of the daughter of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Her Excellency the Prime Minister of Bangladesh </span><span style="color: #333333;">Sheikh Hasina</span><span style="color: #333333;">. The significance to establish a university by the name of the Great Poet Rabindranath Tagore was brought before the knowledge of the Prime Minister by eminent national politician and the Minister for Information of the Government of Bangladesh Mr. Hasanul Haq Inu, MP. </span></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><span style="color: #333333;">As I hold on dreams and I am trying to convert them into reality, over the years I used to dream of starting a campus with curriculum based education. Those who know me, know that I have implemented fully curriculum based Law Honours Programme at Islamic University under the auspices of World Bank funded HEQEP Project of UGC - first ever in the history of legal education in Bangladesh. But that is just a part of a whole. In </span><span style="color: #333333;">Rabindra Maitree University,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #333333;">everything is structured and well-planned. All the approved programs of Rabindra Maitree University have started with well formatted curriculum. In all curriculums Bengali Literature as well as Rabindra Studies is compulsory for all programs because I know how important it is for a Bengalee to know this legend of legends. As a visionary I want to build the entire edifice of RMU with the education philosophy of the Great Poet Rabindranath Tagore. This place is not for irregular students and my aim is to turn the students into diversified manpower with profound knowledge. </span></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><span style="color: #333333;">I have implemented the UGC rules with the help of Vice-Chancellor at RMU. Our teachers are selected through clear and proper recruitment process and they are well-learned in their respected areas. They are recruited and getting paid according to the UGC rules.</span></p>
    <p><a name="_GoBack"></a> As I look ahead, I can visualize this university will attain greater heights and be a Centre of Excellence in education, research and extension by enhancing quality in teaching and research, fostering and promoting innovation and producing world class leaders to meet the demand of time. Our motto is thus learning, creating and leading.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We always believe that the university will occupy a pivotal position in the matrix of world ranking very soon.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>My blessing and good wishes are always with the university.</p>
